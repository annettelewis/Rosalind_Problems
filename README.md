# Rosalind_Problems - Python Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to **Rosalind's bioinformatics challenges** using **Python**. Rosalind is an online platform that provides a collection of programming problems in computational biology and bioinformatics.

## About Rosalind
[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) is a platform designed for learning bioinformatics through problem-solving. The problems range from **basic programming exercises** to more advanced topics such as **DNA sequence analysis, probability, dynamic programming, and graph theory**.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main directories:
- **Problem_Files/** → Contains the original problem input files.  
- **Python_Solutions/** → Contains Python scripts with solutions to the problems.
